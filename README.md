# deep-learning-challenge

## Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Compiling, training and evaluating the model:

The model was required to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than
75%. 

We made three official attempts using machine learning and neural networks.

They all resulted in the same accuracy rate – right around 72%, so a little short of
the required target accuracy.

## Summary

In the three attempts, the model was unable to achieve a target
predictive accuracy higher than 72.8%. 

Hypertuning resulted in virtually no improvement. 

We would consider using another classification model to see if it is
better at predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet
Soup.

## To run the code, please follow these steps:
